logic behind this code is we have bidirectional roads to city with distance 1 unit. hence we have to match the list of hotspots and lists of connected cities (viruns can only spread to city only if that city is conncetd to hotspot) and increament our count. where we have to avoid duplication on virus spread to same city by different hotspots. we can remove those roads from our count. and we can get final count.
